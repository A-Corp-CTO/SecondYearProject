    "### 1. Baseline\n",
    "To get your project started, you start with implementing a baseline model. Ideally, this is going to be the main baseline that you are going to compare to in your paper. Note that this baseline should be more advanced than just predicting O (the majority class).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following datasets for each of the tasks:\n",
    "* EWT for Named Entity Recognition (NER): https://github.com/bplank/nested-ner , use `en_ewt_nn_train.conll` for training, and `en_ewt_nn_answers_test.conll` for testing (note that you can use the dev split for development). **You only have to take into account the 2nd column for the baseline, i.e. the task is not nested NER**\n",
    "* CrossRE for Relation Extraction (RE): https://github.com/mainlp/CrossRE , use `music-train.json` for training, and `music-test.json` for testing (note that you can use the dev split for development).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you do not have to implement your baseline from scratch, you can use for example: https://github.itu.dk/robv/intro-nlp2023/blob/main/assignments/week3/viterbi-solution/viterbi_solution_cleaner.py , https://github.itu.dk/robv/intro-nlp2023/blob/main/assignments/week5/rnn.py or https://github.itu.dk/robv/intro-nlp2023/blob/main/assignments/week6/bert/bert-topic.py as a starting point.\n",

    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis is essential for the interpretation of your results. In this section we will shortly describe some different types of analysis. We strongly suggest to use at least one of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ablation study**: Leave out a certain part of the model, to study its effects. For example, disable the tokenizer, remove a certain (group of) feature(s), or disable the stop-word removal. If the performance drops a lot, it means that this part of the model contributes heavily to the models final performance. This is commonly done in 1 table, while disabling different parts of the model. Note that you can also do this the other way around, i.e. use only one feature (group) at a time, and test performance\n",
    "* **Learning curve**: Evaluate how much data your model needs to reach a certain performance. Especially for the data augmentation projects this is essential.\n",
    "* **Quantitative analysis**: Automated means of analyzing in which cases your model performs worse. This can for example be done with a confusion matrix (like in [week2](https://github.itu.dk/bapl/2ndyearproject-2021-material/blob/master/assignments/week2/week2.ipynb)).\n",
    "* **Qualitative analysis**: Manually inspect a certain number of errors, and try to categorize them/find trends. Can be combined with the quantitative analysis, i.e., inspect 100 cases of positive reviews predicted to be negative and 100 cases of negative reviews predicted to be positive\n",
    "* **Feature importance**: In traditional machine learning methods, one can often extract and inspect the weights of the features. In sklearn these can be found in: `trained_model.coef_`\n",
    "* **Input words importance**: To gain insight into which words have a impact on prediction performance (positive, negative), we can analyze per-word impact: given a trained model, replace a given word with\n",
    "the unknown word token and observe the change in prediction score (probability for a class). This is\n",
    "shown in Figure 4 of [Rethmeier et al (2018)](https://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6246) (a paper on controversy detection), also shown below: red-colored\n",
    "tokens were important for controversy detection, blue-colored token decreased prediction scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=400px src=example.png>\n",
